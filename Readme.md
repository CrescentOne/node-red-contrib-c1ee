# c1ee - how to create and publish a new Node-Red Node
*this project has been setup to investigate how to create a new node for Node-Red*

## Project description
The project is rather simple and has been setup to practice creating a new node for the Node-Red low code platform. As a software organisation we use the platform to develop smaller solutions to integrate our ERP platform with commonly used solutions. For instance to enable customers to integrate with a [sales configurator](https://www.sofon.com/en/products/sales-configurator)

- We believe that being smart and agile by combining strong and trusted propositions does generate far more added value to customers, than trying to build proprietary solutions that locks in customers.
- We believe that doing so we can deliver more quality and have a lot more fun.
- We believe customers are willing to award us a fare share by opening up opportunities

## The c1ee is a fun node
C1ee node is a easter egg, but created, under version control, added to NPM and published to the Node-Red library.
So the node is available in the Node-Red pallet and can be added.

C1ee can be configured with a path and an extension. The input is than checked against those values (extension and file content). The input will result in a correct or incorrect output.

## Credits

The c1ee is developed and published by the [CrescentOne](www.crescentone.nl) development team. We have to thank [Xander van Hunen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xander-van-hunen-495a8a1b8/?originalSubdomain=nl) for his support on figuring out the steps.
